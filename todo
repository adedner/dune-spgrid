dune-spgrid's To-Do-List
------------------------

Parallelization:
 * implement communication
 * implement iterators for different partitions
 * adapt local / global id set to partitioning
 * correct partitioning for periodic grids

Refinement techniques:
 * implement bisection refinement

Id Sets:
 * id set needs to return the same id for each copy of a vertex

Extended Iterators:
 * simplify access
