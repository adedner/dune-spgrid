dune-spgrid's To-Do-List
------------------------

Parallelization:
 * implement communication
 * add ghosts
 * adapt local / global id set to partitioning
 * update superentity iterators to partitioning
 * decomposition should just store a std::vector
 * correctly implement overlapSize and ghostSize

Refinement techniques:
 * implement bisection refinement

Id Sets:
 * id set needs to return the same id for each copy of a vertex

Extended Iterators:
 * simplify access

Utitities:
 * specialize hierarchic search (can be implemented faster)

Documentation:
 * main page (introducing SPGrid and its features)
 * design concepts
 * superentity iterators
 * split into modules (e.g., interface / implementation)
 * document high-level interface classes
 * document low-level implementation classes
