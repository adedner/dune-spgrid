dune-spgrid's To-Do-List
------------------------

Periodicity:
 * support glueing of multiple (fitting) interval blocks

Parallelization:
 * add ghosts
 * decomposition should just store a std::vector
 * correctly implement overlapSize and ghostSize
 * implement load balance (with selectable number of non-empty processes)
 * support OpenMP parallelized iterators

Id Sets:
 * adapt local / global id set to partitioning

Extended Iterators:
 * update superentity iterators to partitioning
 * simplify access

Documentation:
 * design concepts
 * superentity iterators
 * split into modules (e.g., interface / implementation)
 * document high-level interface classes
 * document low-level implementation classes
