-----------

The DUNE module dune-spgrid provides a structured, parallel grid. Though the
dune-grid module already contains two structured grids, SGrid and YaspGrid,
both lack several important features (see below for details).


Features:

The following table compares the features of SPGrid to those of SGrid and
YaspGrid:
