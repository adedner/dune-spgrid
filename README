dune-spgrid
-----------

The DUNE module dune-spgrid provides a structured, parallel grid. Though the
dune-grid module already contains two structured grids, SGrid and YaspGrid,
both lack several important features (see below for details).


Features:

The following table compares the features of SPGrid to those of SGrid and
YaspGrid:

                                      | SGrid    | YaspGrid | SPGrid
--------------------------------------+----------+----------+----------
Provides entities for codimensions    |   all    |  0, dim  |    all
Can communicate on codimensions       |   none   |  0, dim  |    all
Coordinate type is template parameter |    no    |    no    |    yes
Supports anisotropic refinement       |    no    |    no    |    yes
Supports periodicity                  |    no    |    no    |    yes


Preprocessor Magic:

SPGrid can be used through the preprocessor magic. The following table shows how
to select different variants of SPGrid:

GRIDTYPE           | Refinement
-------------------+-----------------------
SPGRID             | Default (Anisotropic)
SPGRID_ISOTROPIC   | Isotropic
SPGRID_ANISOTROPIC | Anisotropic
SPGRID_BISECTION   | Bisection
